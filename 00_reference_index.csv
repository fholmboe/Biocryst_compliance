Betschel_2019;;2019;Betschel;;;"Allergy, Asthma &amp; Clinical Immunology";;;;;AbstractThis is an update to the 2014 Canadian Hereditary Angioedema Guideline with an expanded scope to include the management of hereditary angioedema (HAE) patients worldwide. It is a collaboration of Canadian and international HAE experts and patient groups led by the Canadian Hereditary Angioedema Network. The objective of this guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations, using the GRADE system, for the management of patients with HAE. This includes the treatment of attacks, short-term prophylaxis, long-term prophylaxis, and recommendations for self-administration, individualized therapy, quality of life, and comprehensive care. New to the 2019 version of this guideline are sections covering the diagnosis and recommended therapies for acute treatment in HAE patients with normal C1-INH, as well as sections on pregnant and paediatric patients, patient associations and an HAE registry. Hereditary angioedema results in random and often unpredictable attacks of painful swelling typically affecting the extremities, bowel mucosa, genitals, face and upper airway. Attacks are associated with significant functional impairment, decreased health-related quality of life, and mortality in the case of laryngeal attacks. Caring for patients with HAE can be challenging due to the complexity of this disease. The care of patients with HAE in Canada, as in many countries, continues to be neither optimal nor uniform. It lags behind some other countries where there are more organized models for HAE management, and greater availability of additional licensed therapeutic options. It is anticipated that providing this guideline to caregivers, policy makers, patients, and advocates will not only optimize the management of HAE, but also promote the importance of individualized care. The primary target users of this guideline are healthcare providers who are managing patients with HAE. Other healthcare providers who may use this guideline are emergency and intensive care physicians, primary care physicians, gastroenterologists, dentists, otolaryngologists, paediatricians, and gynaecologists who will encounter patients with HAE and need to be aware of this condition. Hospital administrators, insurers and policy makers may also find this guideline helpful.;;10.1186/s13223-019-0376-8

Cassano_2021;;2021;Cassano;;;Clinical and Molecular Allergy;;;;;Abstract                 Background                 Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors, also known as gliptins, are a class of oral antidiabetic agents. Postmarketing reports have documented the occurrence of angioedema in patients treated with gliptins and it was found that these drugs increased the risk of angioedema in patients concurrently treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). The aim of this manuscript is to provide an overview of the risk of angioedema associated with gliptins.                                Methods                 The keywords used for the literature search in the PubMed database included “angioedema” and “dipeptidyl peptidase”, “gliptins”, or the name of each DPP-IV inhibitor. Articles in English published up to December 2020 were taken into consideration.                                Results                 The available data appear to rule out a higher risk of angioedema associated with gliptin monotherapy and have revealed an increased susceptibility in patients simultaneously treated with gliptins and ACEIs. However, one single multicenter phase IV trial and case reports, even if very limited in number, have shown that angioedema can also occur during treatment with DPP-IV inhibitors without the concomitant use of ACEIs. The involvement of other drugs and drug interactions has occasionally been suggested. In a few patients, deficiency of enzymes involved in bradykinin catabolism was detected and this finding can constitute a risk factor for angioedema exacerbated by treatment with DPP-IV inhibitors.                                Conclusions                 This risk of angioedema associated with the use of gliptins has mostly been related to the concurrent administration of ACEIs, and has been considered rare, but it might be underestimated and underreported. The role of additional risk factors or drug interactions deserves further investigations. Caution should be taken when considering the use of DPP-IV inhibitors in patients treated with ACEIs or presenting with other known risk factors for angioedema.;;10.1186/s12948-021-00164-7

Farkas_2021;;2021;Farkas;;;Clinical and Translational Allergy;;;;;"AbstractBackgroundBerotralstat (BCX7353) is an oral, once‐daily inhibitor of plasma kallikrein recently approved for prevention of angioedema attacks in adults and adolescents with hereditary angioedema (HAE). The objective of this report is to summarize results from an interim analysis of an ongoing long‐term safety study of berotralstat in patients with HAE.MethodsAPeX‐S is an ongoing, phase 2, open‐label study conducted in 22 countries (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03472040). Eligible patients with a clinical diagnosis of HAE due to C1 inhibitor deficiency (HAE‐C1‐INH) were centrally allocated to receive berotralstat 150 or 110 mg once daily. The primary objective was to determine long‐term safety and the secondary objective was to evaluate effectiveness.ResultsEnrolled patients (N = 227) received berotralstat 150 mg (n = 127) or 110 mg (n = 100) once daily. The median (range) duration of exposure was 342 (11–540) and 307 (14–429) days for the 150‐mg and 110‐mg groups, respectively. Treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 91% (n = 206) of patients. The most common TEAEs across treatment groups were upper respiratory tract infection (n = 91, 40%), abdominal pain (n = 57, 25%), headache (n = 40, 18%), and diarrhea (n = 31, 14%) and were mostly mild to moderate. Fifty percent (n = 113) of patients had at least one drug‐related adverse event (AE; 150 mg, n = 57 [45%]; 110 mg, n = 56 [56%]), and discontinuations due to AEs occurred in 19 (8%) patients (150 mg, n = 13 [10%]; 110 mg, n = 6 [6%]). Three (1.3%) patients experienced a drug‐related serious TEAE. Among patients who received berotralstat through 48 weeks (150 mg, n = 73; 110 mg, n = 30), median HAE attack rates were low in month 1 (150 mg, 1.0 attacks/month; 110 mg, 0.5 attacks/month) and remained low through 12 months (0 attacks/month in both dose groups). Mean HAE attack rates followed a similar trend, and no evidence for patient tolerance to berotralstat emerged. In both dose groups, angioedema quality of life scores showed clinically meaningful changes from baseline.ConclusionsIn this analysis, both berotralstat doses, 150  and 110 mg once daily, were generally well tolerated. Effectiveness results support the durability and robustness of berotralstat as prophylactic therapy in patients with HAE.Trial registrationThe study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03472040).";;10.1002/clt2.12035

Gower_2021;;2021;Gower;;;"Allergy, Asthma &amp; Clinical Immunology";;;;;AbstractBackgroundHereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by unpredictable localized episodes of edema, which is frequently managed with long-term prophylactic medications. Until recently, long-term prophylaxis has predominantly required regular intravenous or subcutaneous administration, however the recent approval of berotralstat (Orladeyo™) offers an orally administered prophylactic which may be associated with a lower burden of treatment compared to injectable options for some patients.Case presentationThis report describes four participants in the APeX-S trial who transitioned from subcutaneously administered lanadelumab (Takhzyro®) to daily oral berotralstat for long-term HAE prophylaxis. Lanadelumab dosing continued after berotralstat commencement in all patients and was tapered before discontinuation in three of the four patients. No substantial increases in HAE attack rates were observed after the transition to berotralstat monotherapy. One patient experienced a treatment-related adverse event (dyspepsia), which was mild and self-resolving.ConclusionsAll four patients described in this case series successfully transitioned from lanadelumab to berotralstat monotherapy for long-term prophylaxis without significant complications and without the use of a complex transition protocol. The decision to transition to berotralstat monotherapy and how the transition should be achieved was discussed between patient and physician, ensuring that the comfort and perspectives of the patients were considered during the treatment transition. This report highlights the importance of individualization of HAE management plans to address both the disease and treatment burdens of HAE, and thus to provide the best possible quality of life for each patient.;;10.1186/s13223-021-00603-9

Few states in developing countries have an adequate management of HAE, but none of them belongs to the former USSR area. This study analyses data from C1-INH-HAE patients from Belarus.                                Methods                 Data about clinical characteristics, genetics, access to diagnosis and treatment were collected from 2010 by the Belarusian Research Center for Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Immunology in Minsk. A questionnaire about attacks, prophylactic (LTP) and on-demand therapy (ODT) was administered to patients.                                Results                 We identified 64 C1-INH-HAE patients belonging to 26 families, 27 (42.2%) of which were diagnosed in the last 3 years. The estimated minimal prevalence was 1:148,000. Median age at diagnosis was 29 years, with diagnostic delay of 19 years. Thirty-eight patients answered a questionnaire about therapy. Eleven patients did not use any treatment to resolve HAE attacks. Twenty-seven patients underwent ODT: 9 with appropriate treatments, and 18 with inappropriate treatments. Nine patients used LTP with attenuated androgens and 1 with tranexamic acid. Thirty-two patients answered a questionnaire about attacks and triggers: 368 angioedema attacks were reported, with an average of 10 attacks per year. We found 24 different SERPING1 variants: 9 missenses, 6 in splice sites, 6 small deletions, 2 nonsense, 1 large deletion; 7 have not been previously described. De novo variants were found in 11 patients.                                Conclusions                 C1-INH-HAE diagnosis and management in Belarus is improved as seen from the high number of new diagnosis in the last 3 years. Next steps will be to reduce the diagnostic delay and to promote the LTP and ODT.";;10.1186/s12948-021-00141-0

Magerl_2024;;2024;Magerl;;;Frontiers in Medicine;;;;;IntroductionHereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare hereditary disease with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 in 50,000.MethodsAn online survey was performed between January and June 2021 on a total of 99 HAE patients (with 92 of them aged 15 years and older and 7 of them being parents of patients under the age of 15 years). They were asked about their current situation, with a focus on the disease.ResultsThe survey results show that HAE has a strong influence on the patients’ quality of life. In particular, the anxiety and uncertainty of not knowing when a swelling attack will occur is considered burdensome by the patients. In addition, there can be physical problems during an attack (depending on its severity) that severely burden and limit patients in their everyday lives. Only one-third of the patients surveyed stated that no or only very minor physical limitations occurred during their most recent swelling attack. Almost three-quarters of all patients receive regular treatment at an HAE center. The patients are mostly satisfied with the therapy and particularly with long-term prophylactics (LTPs). When an LTP was used, the frequency and severity of the swelling attacks, and their duration, were significantly lower and/or shorter than when no LTP was used.DiscussionDespite the high level of satisfaction with their current medication, 62% of patients expressed a strong/very strong interest in an oral LTP. In the group of patients already using an LTP, 74% reported a strong/very strong interest in an oral medication for long-term prophylaxis. The simplicity and minimal time involved in LTP use are considered beneficial to patients’ quality of life.;;10.3389/fmed.2023.1274397
Maurer_2022;The Icatibant Outcome Survey: 10 years of experience with icatibant for patients with hereditary angioedema;2022;Maurer;;;Clinical & Experimental Allergy;;;;;"AbstractIn patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE), bradykinin causes swelling episodes by activating bradykinin B2 receptors. Icatibant, a selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, is approved for on‐demand treatment of HAE attacks. The Icatibant Outcome Survey (IOS; NCT01034969) is an ongoing observational registry initiated in 2009 to monitor the effectiveness/safety of icatibant in routine clinical practice. As of March 2019, 549 patients with HAE type 1 or 2 from the IOS registry had been treated of 5995 total attacks. This article reviews data published from IOS over time which have demonstrated that the effectiveness of icatibant in a real‐world setting is comparable to efficacy in clinical trials; one dose is effective for the majority of attacks; early treatment (facilitated by self‐administration) leads to faster resolution and shorter attack duration; effectiveness/safety of icatibant has been shown across a broad range of patient subgroups, including children/adolescents and patients with HAE with normal C1 inhibitor levels; and tolerability has been demonstrated in patients aged ≥65 years. Additionally, this review highlights how IOS data have provided valuable insights into patients' diagnostic journeys and treatment behaviours across individual countries. Such findings have helped to inform clinical strategies and guidelines to optimise HAE management and limit disease burden. This research was sponsored by Takeda Development Center Americas, Inc.

Maurer_2022;The international WAO/EAACI guideline for the management of hereditary angioedema—The 2021 revision and update;2022;Maurer;;;Allergy;;;;;AbstractHereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare and disabling disease for which early diagnosis and effective therapy are critical. This revision and update of the global WAO/EAACI guideline on the diagnosis and management of HAE provides up‐to‐date guidance for the management of HAE. For this update and revision of the guideline, an international panel of experts reviewed the existing evidence, developed 28 recommendations, and established consensus by an online DELPHI process. The goal of these recommendations and guideline is to help physicians and their patients in making rational decisions in the management of HAE with deficient C1 inhibitor (type 1) and HAE with dysfunctional C1 inhibitor (type 2), by providing guidance on common and important clinical issues, such as: (1) How should HAE be diagnosed? (2) When should HAE patients receive prophylactic on top of on‐demand treatment and what treatments should be used? (3) What are the goals of treatment? (4) Should HAE management be different for special HAE patient groups such as children or pregnant/breast‐feeding women? and (5) How should HAE patients monitor their disease activity, impact, and control? It is also the intention of this guideline to help establish global standards for the management of HAE and to encourage and facilitate the use of recommended diagnostics and therapies for all patients.;;10.1111/all.15214

Ohsawa_2020;;2020;Ohsawa;;;Allergy;;;;;"AbstractBackgroundWith no approved treatments in Japan for the prevention of hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks, there is a significant unmet need for long‐term prophylactic therapies for Japanese patients with HAE. Berotralstat (BCX7353) is an oral, once‐daily, highly selective inhibitor of plasma kallikrein in development for prophylaxis of angioedema attacks in HAE patients.MethodsAPeX‐J is a phase 3, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group, 3‐part trial conducted in Japan (University Hospital Medical Information Network identifier, UMIN000034869; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT03873116). Patients with a clinical diagnosis of type 1 or 2 HAE underwent a prospective run‐in period of 56 days to determine eligibility, allowing enrollment of those with ≥2 expert‐confirmed angioedema attacks. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) and stratified by baseline attack rate (≥2 vs. &lt;2 expert‐confirmed attacks/month between screening and randomization) to receive once‐daily berotralstat 110 mg, berotralstat 150 mg, or placebo. The primary endpoint was the rate of expert‐confirmed angioedema attacks during dosing in the 24‐week treatment period.ResultsNineteen patients were randomized to receive once‐daily berotralstat 110 mg (n = 6), berotralstat 150 mg (n = 7), or placebo (n = 6). Treatment with berotralstat 150 mg significantly reduced HAE attacks relative to placebo (1.11 vs. 2.18 attacks/month, p = .003). The most frequently reported treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in berotralstat‐treated patients (n = 13) were nasopharyngitis (n = 4, 31%), abdominal pain, cough, diarrhea, and pyrexia (n = 2 each, 15%).ConclusionsOrally administered, once‐daily berotralstat 150 mg significantly reduced the frequency of HAE attacks and was safe and well tolerated, supporting its use as a prophylactic therapy in patients with type 1 or 2 HAE in Japan.";;10.1111/all.14670

Pagnier_2024;Hereditary angioedema in children: Review and practical perspective for clinical management;2024;Pagnier;;;Pediatric Allergy and Immunology;;;;;AbstractBackgroundHereditary angioedema (HAE) in children has specific features and requires multidisciplinary management.MethodsWe performed a literature search and underwent in‐depth discussions to provide practical tools for physicians.ResultsHAE is a rare, life‐threatening genetic disorder. Its epidemiology is poorly documented in children. Clinical manifestations usually appear during childhood or early adolescence. Classical signs, often preceded by prodromal symptoms, include transient, localized, non‐pitting, non‐pruritic swelling of deep dermal/subcutaneous or mucosal/submucosal tissues, leading to oedema of the extremities, face, lips, tongue, trunk and genitals, recurring gastrointestinal symptoms and laryngeal edema possibly causing asphyxiation and death. Diagnosis is often delayed due to low awareness in the medical community, and particularly challenging in case of isolated abdominal crises or atypical presentation and in neonates or infants. It relies on biological tests (measurement of serum/plasma levels of C1INH function, C1INH protein, and C4), genetic testing in selected cases, and imaging for differential diagnosis of acute abdominal crises. Main differential diagnosis for peripheral oedema is mast cell‐mediated oedema that accounts for 95% of angioedema in clinical practice. Quality of life can be significantly impaired. Disease management includes treatment of attacks, short‐term and long‐term prophylaxis, psychological support, avoidance of triggers, patients’ and parents’ education and coordination of all stakeholders, ideally within a specialized healthcare network. New plasma kallikrein inhibitors, namely lanadelumab (subcutaneous route) and berotralstat (oral route) have facilitated long‐term prophylaxis thanks to improved usability.ConclusionDiagnostic and treatment of HAE are particularly challenging in children and require specific management by multiple stakeholders.;;10.1111/pai.14268

Sundler Björkman_2022;Comorbidities in hereditary angioedema-A population-based cohort study;2022;Sundler Björkman;;;Clinical and Translational Allergy;;;;;"AbstractBackgroundIn hereditary angioedema (HAE), low levels (type 1) or defect in function (type 2) of the serine‐protease inhibitor C1 Inhibitor protein results in activation of the classical pathway of the complement system as well as the contact system. Here, we investigated the risk of comorbidities in HAE.MethodsIndividuals with HAE (n = 239; identified through a physician made diagnosis) and a control cohort from the general population (n = 2383; matched for age, gender, and county of residence) were compared with the Swedish inpatient, cause of death, cancer, and prescription registers. Conditional logistic regression was used to analyze the data.ResultsIncreased risk of cardiovascular disease (odds ratio [OR] 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32–2.54), including arterial (OR 6.74; 95% CI 1.89–24.06) and venous thromboembolic disease (OR 4.20; 95% CI 2.42–7.23) as well as hypertension (OR 1.64; 95% CI 1.12–2.39) was seen in HAE. There was also an increased number of individuals diagnosed with hyperlipidemia (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.16–3.50) among HAE patients. Furthermore, the risk of autoimmune disease was increased (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.15–2.35) being particularly pronounced for systemic lupus erythematosus (OR 71.87; 95% CI 8.80–586.7). The risk of having two or more autoimmune diseases was also higher among HAE patients (p = 0.017). In contrast, the risk of cancer was not increased. Data from the prescription register revealed higher prescription rates of drugs against hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia among HAE patients.ConclusionsThe results warrant for awareness and prevention of comorbid conditions, in particular, thromboembolic and autoimmune diseases in HAE. Future prophylactic interventions may modify these risks.";;10.1002/clt2.12135

We aimed at investigating prevalence of depression and anxiety in patients with HAE in Leipzig, Germany. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Questionnaire-based evaluation of medical history, Angioedema Control Test (AECT), Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE-QoL), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Thirty-seven patients with HAE were included (31 females, mean age 49.6 ± 17.5 years). A mean diagnostic delay between first symptoms and correct diagnosis of 14.2 ± 14.5 years was detected. Patients aged &amp;#x3c;50 years (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 18) had been diagnosed significantly earlier with HAE than older patients (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = &amp;#x3c;0.001). In 6 patients (16.2%), unnecessary medical interventions were performed and 14 patients (43.8%) reported at least 1 HAE-related death of a family member. Psychological stress was the most common triggering factor (96.2%). HADS scores revealed depression in 5/37 patients (13.5%) and anxiety in 16/37 (43.2%), GAD-7 score indicated anxiety in 9/36 (25%) participants. Patients receiving long-term prophylactic treatment (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 17, 45.9%) showed significantly better disease control (AECT; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = &amp;#x3c;0.001) and quality of life (AE-QoL; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = &amp;#x3c;0.001) compared to those with on-demand treatment only. Patients with long-term prophylactic treatment showed significantly lower scores for anxiety and depression at GAD-7 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011) and HADS (anxiety: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.021; depression: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008). In 5 patients, treatment regime was changed as AECT score indicated insufficient disease control. Subsequently, we measured significant improvement of quality of life (AE-QoL, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04) and disease control (AECT; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.032). &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Anxiety was a frequent burden in our study group and showed a significant association with low disease control.
