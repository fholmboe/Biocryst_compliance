The International/Canadian Hereditary Angioedema Guideline. Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol. 2019;15:72.;This is an update to the 2014 Canadian Hereditary Angioedema Guideline with an expanded scope to include the management of hereditary angioedema (HAE) patients worldwide. It is a collaboration of Canadian and international HAE experts and patient groups led by the Canadian Hereditary Angioedema Network. The objective of this guideline is to provide evidence based recommendations, using the GRADE system, for the management of patients with HAE. This includes the treatment of attacks, short term prophylaxis, long term prophylaxis, and recommendations for self administration, individualized therapy, quality of life, and comprehensive care. New to the 2019 version are sections covering the diagnosis and recommended therapies for acute treatment in HAE patients with normal C1 INH, as well as sections on pregnant and paediatric patients, patient associations and an HAE registry. Hereditary angioedema causes unpredictable attacks of painful swelling that impair quality of life and can be fatal in laryngeal episodes. Care remains variable worldwide; this guideline aims to optimise and individualise management.;Comprehensive 2019 update employing GRADE methodology 28 recommendations spanning diagnosis therapy quality of life and individualized care extending guidance beyond Canada.;10.1186/s13223-019-0376-8
Cassano_2021;;2021;Cassano;;;Clinical and Molecular Allergy;;;;;Abstract                 Background                 Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors, also known as gliptins, are a class of oral antidiabetic agents. Postmarketing reports have documented the occurrence of angioedema in patients treated with gliptins and it was found that these drugs increased the risk of angioedema in patients concurrently treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). The aim of this manuscript is to provide an overview of the risk of angioedema associated with gliptins.                                Methods                 The keywords used for the literature search in the PubMed database included “angioedema” and “dipeptidyl peptidase”, “gliptins”, or the name of each DPP-IV inhibitor. Articles in English published up to December 2020 were taken into consideration.                                Results                 The available data appear to rule out a higher risk of angioedema associated with gliptin monotherapy and have revealed an increased susceptibility in patients simultaneously treated with gliptins and ACEIs. However, one single multicenter phase IV trial and case reports, even if very limited in number, have shown that angioedema can also occur during treatment with DPP-IV inhibitors without the concomitant use of ACEIs. The involvement of other drugs and drug interactions has occasionally been suggested. In a few patients, deficiency of enzymes involved in bradykinin catabolism was detected and this finding can constitute a risk factor for angioedema exacerbated by treatment with DPP-IV inhibitors.                                Conclusions                 This risk of angioedema associated with the use of gliptins has mostly been related to the concurrent administration of ACEIs, and has been considered rare, but it might be underestimated and underreported. The role of additional risk factors or drug interactions deserves further investigations. Caution should be taken when considering the use of DPP-IV inhibitors in patients treated with ACEIs or presenting with other known risk factors for angioedema.;;10.1186/s12948-021-00164-7

Specific Targeting of Plasma Kallikrein for Treatment of Hereditary Angioedema: A Revolutionary Decade. J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract. 2022;10(3):716-722.;Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare chronic genetic disease characterised by non‑pruritic swelling of the skin, airway, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. Type I and II HAE result from SERPING1 mutations causing C1 inhibitor dysfunction and excessive bradykinin generation, whereas HAE with normal C1 inhibitor has other genetic mechanisms. Plasma kallikrein inhibitors inhibit the kallikrein‑kinin pathway to prevent or treat HAE attacks; most are injectable but oral formulations are emerging.

Few states in developing countries have an adequate management of HAE, but none of them belongs to the former USSR area. This study analyses data from C1-INH-HAE patients from Belarus.                                Methods                 Data about clinical characteristics, genetics, access to diagnosis and treatment were collected from 2010 by the Belarusian Research Center for Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Immunology in Minsk. A questionnaire about attacks, prophylactic (LTP) and on-demand therapy (ODT) was administered to patients.                                Results                 We identified 64 C1-INH-HAE patients belonging to 26 families, 27 (42.2%) of which were diagnosed in the last 3 years. The estimated minimal prevalence was 1:148,000. Median age at diagnosis was 29 years, with diagnostic delay of 19 years. Thirty-eight patients answered a questionnaire about therapy. Eleven patients did not use any treatment to resolve HAE attacks. Twenty-seven patients underwent ODT: 9 with appropriate treatments, and 18 with inappropriate treatments. Nine patients used LTP with attenuated androgens and 1 with tranexamic acid. Thirty-two patients answered a questionnaire about attacks and triggers: 368 angioedema attacks were reported, with an average of 10 attacks per year. We found 24 different SERPING1 variants: 9 missenses, 6 in splice sites, 6 small deletions, 2 nonsense, 1 large deletion; 7 have not been previously described. De novo variants were found in 11 patients.                                Conclusions                 C1-INH-HAE diagnosis and management in Belarus is improved as seen from the high number of new diagnosis in the last 3 years. Next steps will be to reduce the diagnostic delay and to promote the LTP and ODT.";;10.1186/s12948-021-00141-0

Post‑marketing data indicate an increased risk of angioedema, especially when combined with angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). Methods: PubMed literature search to December 2020. Results: Gliptin monotherapy shows minimal angioedema risk, but susceptibility rises markedly with concurrent ACEIs; rare cases occur without ACEIs, with other drugs or bradykinin‑catabolism defects as possible factors. Conclusions: Angioedema with gliptins is rare yet probably under‑reported; clinicians should exercise caution, particularly in patients receiving ACEIs.;Systematic review concludes gliptins rarely cause angioedema alone but risk rises with ACE inhibitors highlights under‑reporting and recommends vigilance and personalized risk assessment.;10.1186/s12948-021-00164-7

Maurer_EAACI_2022;The international WAO/EAACI guideline for the management of hereditary angioedema—The 2021 revision and update;2022;Maurer;;;Allergy;;;;;AbstractHereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare and disabling disease for which early diagnosis and effective therapy are critical. This revision and update of the global WAO/EAACI guideline on the diagnosis and management of HAE provides up‐to‐date guidance for the management of HAE. For this update and revision of the guideline, an international panel of experts reviewed the existing evidence, developed 28 recommendations, and established consensus by an online DELPHI process. The goal of these recommendations and guideline is to help physicians and their patients in making rational decisions in the management of HAE with deficient C1 inhibitor (type 1) and HAE with dysfunctional C1 inhibitor (type 2), by providing guidance on common and important clinical issues, such as: (1) How should HAE be diagnosed? (2) When should HAE patients receive prophylactic on top of on‐demand treatment and what treatments should be used? (3) What are the goals of treatment? (4) Should HAE management be different for special HAE patient groups such as children or pregnant/breast‐feeding women? and (5) How should HAE patients monitor their disease activity, impact, and control? It is also the intention of this guideline to help establish global standards for the management of HAE and to encourage and facilitate the use of recommended diagnostics and therapies for all patients.;;10.1111/all.15214

Pagnier_2024;Hereditary angioedema in children: Review and practical perspective for clinical management;2024;Pagnier;;;Pediatric Allergy and Immunology;;;;;AbstractBackgroundHereditary angioedema (HAE) in children has specific features and requires multidisciplinary management.MethodsWe performed a literature search and underwent in‐depth discussions to provide practical tools for physicians.ResultsHAE is a rare, life‐threatening genetic disorder. Its epidemiology is poorly documented in children. Clinical manifestations usually appear during childhood or early adolescence. Classical signs, often preceded by prodromal symptoms, include transient, localized, non‐pitting, non‐pruritic swelling of deep dermal/subcutaneous or mucosal/submucosal tissues, leading to oedema of the extremities, face, lips, tongue, trunk and genitals, recurring gastrointestinal symptoms and laryngeal edema possibly causing asphyxiation and death. Diagnosis is often delayed due to low awareness in the medical community, and particularly challenging in case of isolated abdominal crises or atypical presentation and in neonates or infants. It relies on biological tests (measurement of serum/plasma levels of C1INH function, C1INH protein, and C4), genetic testing in selected cases, and imaging for differential diagnosis of acute abdominal crises. Main differential diagnosis for peripheral oedema is mast cell‐mediated oedema that accounts for 95% of angioedema in clinical practice. Quality of life can be significantly impaired. Disease management includes treatment of attacks, short‐term and long‐term prophylaxis, psychological support, avoidance of triggers, patients’ and parents’ education and coordination of all stakeholders, ideally within a specialized healthcare network. New plasma kallikrein inhibitors, namely lanadelumab (subcutaneous route) and berotralstat (oral route) have facilitated long‐term prophylaxis thanks to improved usability.ConclusionDiagnostic and treatment of HAE are particularly challenging in children and require specific management by multiple stakeholders.;;10.1111/pai.14268

Sundler Björkman_2022;Comorbidities in hereditary angioedema-A population-based cohort study;2022;Sundler Björkman;;;Clinical and Translational Allergy;;;;;"AbstractBackgroundIn hereditary angioedema (HAE), low levels (type 1) or defect in function (type 2) of the serine‐protease inhibitor C1 Inhibitor protein results in activation of the classical pathway of the complement system as well as the contact system. Here, we investigated the risk of comorbidities in HAE.MethodsIndividuals with HAE (n = 239; identified through a physician made diagnosis) and a control cohort from the general population (n = 2383; matched for age, gender, and county of residence) were compared with the Swedish inpatient, cause of death, cancer, and prescription registers. Conditional logistic regression was used to analyze the data.ResultsIncreased risk of cardiovascular disease (odds ratio [OR] 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32–2.54), including arterial (OR 6.74; 95% CI 1.89–24.06) and venous thromboembolic disease (OR 4.20; 95% CI 2.42–7.23) as well as hypertension (OR 1.64; 95% CI 1.12–2.39) was seen in HAE. There was also an increased number of individuals diagnosed with hyperlipidemia (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.16–3.50) among HAE patients. Furthermore, the risk of autoimmune disease was increased (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.15–2.35) being particularly pronounced for systemic lupus erythematosus (OR 71.87; 95% CI 8.80–586.7). The risk of having two or more autoimmune diseases was also higher among HAE patients (p = 0.017). In contrast, the risk of cancer was not increased. Data from the prescription register revealed higher prescription rates of drugs against hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia among HAE patients.ConclusionsThe results warrant for awareness and prevention of comorbid conditions, in particular, thromboembolic and autoimmune diseases in HAE. Future prophylactic interventions may modify these risks.";;10.1002/clt2.12135

We aimed at investigating prevalence of depression and anxiety in patients with HAE in Leipzig, Germany. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Questionnaire-based evaluation of medical history, Angioedema Control Test (AECT), Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE-QoL), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Thirty-seven patients with HAE were included (31 females, mean age 49.6 ± 17.5 years). A mean diagnostic delay between first symptoms and correct diagnosis of 14.2 ± 14.5 years was detected. Patients aged &amp;#x3c;50 years (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 18) had been diagnosed significantly earlier with HAE than older patients (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = &amp;#x3c;0.001). In 6 patients (16.2%), unnecessary medical interventions were performed and 14 patients (43.8%) reported at least 1 HAE-related death of a family member. Psychological stress was the most common triggering factor (96.2%). HADS scores revealed depression in 5/37 patients (13.5%) and anxiety in 16/37 (43.2%), GAD-7 score indicated anxiety in 9/36 (25%) participants. Patients receiving long-term prophylactic treatment (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 17, 45.9%) showed significantly better disease control (AECT; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = &amp;#x3c;0.001) and quality of life (AE-QoL; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = &amp;#x3c;0.001) compared to those with on-demand treatment only. Patients with long-term prophylactic treatment showed significantly lower scores for anxiety and depression at GAD-7 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011) and HADS (anxiety: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.021; depression: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008). In 5 patients, treatment regime was changed as AECT score indicated insufficient disease control. Subsequently, we measured significant improvement of quality of life (AE-QoL, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04) and disease control (AECT; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.032). &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Anxiety was a frequent burden in our study group and showed a significant association with low disease control.
